Getting Started with the Django Project

This project provides a Django application to potentially process and access customer data. Here's a guide to set up and run the application locally:


Prerequisites:

Python 3.x installed on your system.
pip (package manager for Python) installed.

Steps:
-> pipenv install
-> pipenv shell
-> python manage.py runserver


Steps:

1. Extract the Zip File:

Extract the downloaded ZIP file containing the Django project files.
Install Dependencies:

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the extracted project directory.

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
pipenv install
This command uses pipenv to create a virtual environment and install the necessary libraries specified in a Pipfile (if it exists) or requirements.txt.

3. Activate Virtual Environment:

If you're using a virtual environment, activate it using the specific command for your operating system. Here are some examples:

Windows: pipenv shell
macOS/Linux: source pipenv/shell.sh
Activating the virtual environment ensures you're using the isolated Python environment with the installed dependencies for this project.

4. Start the Local Development Server:

With the virtual environment activated, run the following command to start the local Django development server:
python manage.py runserver
This command typically starts the server on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (localhost port 8000). You can verify the exact URL and port in the terminal output.

5. Access the Endpoint:

Once the server is running, you can access the endpoint for customer data by opening a web browser and navigating to the following URL:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/customer/

The specific behavior of the endpoint depends on how it's implemented in the Django application
